ðŸ§  Machine Learning Module

Overview

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning (ML) using Python. It covers both the theoretical foundations and hands-on applications through a progression of lessons and projects. Learners will understand how to preprocess data, train and evaluate models, and apply algorithms to real-world problems such as prediction, classification, clustering, and decision-making.
